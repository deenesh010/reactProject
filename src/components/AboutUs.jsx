      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Tourism in Nepal started after the first successful ascent of Mount
        Everest on 29th May 1953 by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary.
        Before 1951 Nepal was closed for foreigners because of autocratic rule
        of Rana regime. After democracy came in 1955, foreigners were welcomed
        by Nepal Government by providing them tourist visa. Before, the visas
        were provided from India by East India Company under the supervision of
        British Government.
